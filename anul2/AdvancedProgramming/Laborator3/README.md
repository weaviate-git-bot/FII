### Compulsory (1p)

- [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes Network, Node, Computer, Router, Switch. The natural ordering of the nodes is given by their names.
- [x] Create the interfaces Identifiable and Storage. The classes above must implement these interfaces accordingly.
- [x] The Network class will contain a List of nodes.
- [x] Create and print all the nodes in the network (without the time costs).

### Homework (2p)
- [x] Each node will contain a Map representing the time costs. Create and print the complete network in the example.
- [x] Create a default method in the interface Storage, that is able to return the storage capacity in other units of storage (megabyte, kilobyte, byte).
- [x] In the Network class, create a method to display the nodes that are identifiable, sorted by their addresses.
- [x] Implement an efficient agorithm to determine all the shortests times required for data packets to travel from an identifiable node to another.
