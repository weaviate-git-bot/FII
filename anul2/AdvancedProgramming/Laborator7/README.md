# Laboratory 7

### Compulsory (1p)

- [x] Create an object oriented model of the problem. You may assume that there are 10 tiles for each letter in the alphabet and each letter is worth a random number of points (between 1 and 10).
- [x] Each player will have a name and they must perform in a concurrent manner, extracting repeatedly tokens from the board.
- [x] After each extraction, the player will submit to the board all the letters.
- [x] Simulate the game using a thread for each player.
- [x] Pay attention to the synchronization of the threads when extracting tokens from the bag and when putting words on the board.

### Homework (2p)

- [x] Use the following number of tiles for each letter: `A-9, B-2, C-2, D-4, E-12, F-2, G-3, H-2, I-9, J-1, K-1, L-4, M-2, N-6, O-8, P-2, Q-1, R-6, S-4, T-6, U-4, V-2, W-2, X-1, Y-2, Z-1`
- [x] Use the following points for the letters:
```
(1 point)-A, E, I, O, U, L, N, S, T, R
(2 points)-D, G
(3 points)-B, C, M, P
(4 points)-F, H, V, W, Y
(5 points)-K
(8 points)- J, X
(10 points)-Q, Z
```
- [x] Create an implementation of a dictionary, using some collection of words. Use an appropriate collection to represent the dictionary. This collection should be large enough; you may use aspell to generate a text file containing English words, or anything similar: WordNet, dexonline, etc.
- [x] Implement the scoring and determine who the winner is at the end of the game.
- [x] Make sure that players wait their turns, using a wait-notify approach.
- [x] Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the game and it will stop the game if it exceeds a certain time limit.
