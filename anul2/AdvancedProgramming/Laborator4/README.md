# Laborator 4

### Compulsory (1p)

- [x] Create a Maven project.
- [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Streets have names and lengths, intersections have names. A street joins two intersections.
- [x] Create the streets and the intersections of the problem described in the example. Use streams in order to easily create the intersections.
- [x] Create a list of streets, using LinkedList implementation and sort it by the length, using a comparator expressed as a lambda-expression or method reference. Make sure all the objects are comparable.
- [x] Create a set of intersections, using a HashSet implementation. Verify the property that a Set does not contain duplicates.

### Homework (2p)
- [x] Create a class that describes the city.
- [x] Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the streets that are longer than a specified value and join at least 3 streets.
- [x] Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for intersections and streets.
- [x] You may use this package of JGraphT in order to solve the problem (or other library).
Note: A personal implementation of the algorithm will be will be scored extra (+1p).
